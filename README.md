# Captcha-Solver
This program is used to solve the programming challenge at http://sloth.highschoolhack.me:6002/index.php    
In essence, a 3x3 grid od dot have 3 colors, gray, red and green    
Clicking a green earns the bot a point, 30 points are needed to win, clicking a red makes the count reset    
About every 40millis, the board changes, it can be all gray, all red, or all gray with 1 green
